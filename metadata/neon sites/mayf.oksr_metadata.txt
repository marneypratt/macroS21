-----------------------------------------


1. Variable List

siteID: Identification of the sampling river.  MAYF = Mayfield Creek, OKSR = Oksrukuyik Creek

date: sampling date in mm/dd/yyyy format 
	dates are all given in month/day/year (mm/dd/yyyy) format in the .csv file but usually given as yyyy-mm-dd when imported in R

year: sampling year

startTime.UTC: the time in hours:minutes:seconds in the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time zone that sampling was started

habitatType: the type of habitat - which is riffle, pool, or run 

samplerType: the type of sampler used to take the sample, 
	see more information from NEON.DOC.003046vE (https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.003046vE)

		
	surber - "Surber sampler: Benthic sampler for flowing waters. A standard Surber sampler consists of a 30 cm x 30 cm frame and a long 243 mm Nitex mesh net that collects organisms (Figure 19)." 

	core - "Hand corer: Benthic sampler for sand- and silt-bottomed streams (Figure 24). Sampler consists of an inner PVC tube and an outer, stainless steel housing for pushing the corer into the substratum. The stainless steel barrel is 5 cm in diameter by 50 cm high with a handle on top."

	snag - 	Modified snag sampling with D-frame net: "Collecting net with handle. The net frame is shaped like a ‘D’, allowing the net to be placed against a stream or lake bottom. The D-frame net has a 30 cm wide opening and 243 mm Nitex mesh collection net with handle."

	modifiedKickNet - "Modified kicknet: Benthic sampler used for faster and deeper water (runs). The modified kicknet has a 33 x 5- cm frame with 243 mm Nitex mesh net attached, and a long handle for holding the net in fast current (Figure 26)."


sampleID: unique identification code for each sample.
	

organism_aggr: the unique name for each organism aggregated for some organisms.	
	Some species are aggregated into a genus (especially a lot of the mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies), family (midges), or class (segmented worms)

acceptedTaxonID: the identification code for each taxon taken from NEON (https://data.neonscience.org/taxonomic-lists)

number: number of organisms of that type for that sample on that day


benthicArea: benthic area in meters squared. Calculated as the area of a 0.25 meter squared quadrat times the number of quadrats.

invDens: invertebrate density in number per meter squared. Calculated as the number of a particular organism divided by the benthic area that the organism was sampled in.

acceptedTaxonID: this is a unique identification code for each taxon based on codes from NEON: 
	https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/endpoints/taxonomy/

tolerance: tolerance for the organism of that type
	The tolerance is the tolerance to organic pollution used to calculate the Hilsenhof Biotic Index.  Most tolerance values used were
	taken from the following resources
	
	Stream Biomonitoring Unit Staff.  2012. Standard operating Procedure: Biological monitoring of surface waters in New York State.  
	New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Division of Water.  Albany, NY.
	
	Aquatic Bioassessment Laboratory. 2003. List of California macroinvertebrate taxa and standard taxonomic effort. 
	California Department of Fish and Game. Rancho Cordova, CA.

FFG: Primary functional feeding group of that organism

	cf - filtering collector 	dominant food: filter feeders or suspension feeders that eat decomposing fine particular matter (FPOM) 
	cg - gathering collector 	dominant food: gathers or deposit feeds on decomposing fine particular matter (FPOM) (includes surface film feeders)
	om - omnivore dominant food: eats a variety of things including plant, animal, and detritus	
	prc - piercer  dominant food: eats by piercing its prey.  
	prd - predator	dominant food: eats living animal tissue.  Often ingests whole or part of another animal
	scr - scraper	 dominant food: scrapes periphyton of surfaces (periphyton = algae and associated material attached to rocks and other substrata)
	sh - shredders 	dominant food: herbivore variety chew and mines live plant material, detritivore variety chews, bores, or gouges decomposing vascular plant 	tissue including wood (course particulate organic matter = CPOM)

mon.precip: monthly precipitation
	total precipitation over 30 day period (including the sampling day) as measured at the TOOL (for OKSR) or TALL (for MAYF) terrestrial sites 
	primary precipitation was measured using a Belfort AEPG II 600M weighing gauge 
	For accrucary see http://belfortinstrument.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Model-AEPG-II-600-1000-All-Environment-Precipitation-Gauge-Data-Sheet-AZ080817.pdf
	For more information and how to cite the data see https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00006.001
      

mon.ADD: monthly Aggregated Degree Days

	Single Aspirated Air Temperature (SAAT) assembly located at the TOOL (for OKSR) or TALL (for MAYF) terrestrial sites
	Thermometrics Climate RTD 100 Ω Probe, housed within a Met One 076B fan aspirated radiation shield (±0.3°C)
	see https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00002.001

	First, the average daily air temperature in Celsius was calculated, and 
	then the average daily values were added up over a 30 day period including the sample date.
	Monthly ADD gives a sense of the accumulated air temperature over a 30 day period and the units are degree days

3. Specialized formats of other abbreviations used
dates are all given in month/day/year (mm/dd/yyyy) format in the .csv file but usually given as yyyy-mm-dd when imported in R
