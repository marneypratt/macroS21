1. Variable List

siteID: Identification of the sampling river.  SYCA = Sycamore Creek

date: sampling date in mm/dd/yyyy format 
	dates are all given in month/day/year (mm/dd/yyyy) format in the .csv file but usually given as yyyy-mm-dd when imported in R

year: sampling year

startTime.UTC: the time in hours:minutes:seconds in the Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) time zone that sampling was started

season: sampling season (Spring, Summer or Fall)

sampleTime: sampling time. Each sampling time is a combition of the season and year, for example Fall 2018 or Summer 2019

habitatType: the type of habitat - which is riffle, pool, or run 

samplerType: the type of sampler used to take the sample, 
	see more information from NEON.DOC.003046vE 	(https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.003046vE)

		
	surber - "Surber sampler: Benthic sampler for flowing waters. A standard Surber sampler consists of a 30 cm x 30 cm frame and a long 243 mm Nitex mesh net that collects organisms (Figure 19)." 

	core - "Hand corer: Benthic sampler for sand- and silt-bottomed streams (Figure 24). Sampler consists of an inner PVC tube and an outer, stainless steel housing for pushing the corer into the substratum. The stainless steel barrel is 5 cm in diameter by 50 cm high with a handle on top."


sampleID: unique identification code for each sample.
	

organism_aggr: the unique name for each organism aggregated for some organisms.	
	Some species are aggregated into a genus (especially a lot of the mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies), family (midges), or class (segmented worms)

acceptedTaxonID: the identification code for each taxon taken from NEON (https://data.neonscience.org/taxonomic-lists)
